# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classification

About Dataset:
### The Asirra (animal species image recognition for restricting access) dataset was introduced in 2013 for a machine learning competition. The dataset includes 25,000 images with equal numbers of labels for cats and dogs.

# Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN Tensorflow.Keras
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. A CNN uses a system much like a multilayer perceptron that has been designed for reduced processing requirements



# Now will be using VGG16
VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
